# Install rpm in CentOS 8

## Prereqs

You need at least these installed:
```
	perl(Env::Path) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(File::ShareDir) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(IO::Pty) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(IO::Stty) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(List::MoreUtils) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(Number::Format) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(Regexp::Common) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
	perl(Regexp::IPv6) is needed by perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch
```

You can try to install all of them via CPAN or endlessly google for their (s)rpms. Not all of them are in repos. I have been there, done that, and it sucks. So here is an easier way:

I have build these, attached into release assets:
```
rpm -Uvh perl-Env-Path-0.19-1.el8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh perl-IO-Stty-0.03-10.el8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh perl-Number-Format-1.73-14.el8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh perl-Regexp-IPv6-0.03-11.el8.noarch.rpm
```

```
yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools && dnf update -y
```

You probably want `epel` enabled too.

```
dnf install perl-File-ShareDir perl-IO-Tty perl-List-MoreUtils perl-Regexp-Common -y
```

```
rpm -Uvh perl-App-Cope-1.1-1.el8.noarch.rpm
```

And have `PATH=$(cope_path.pl):$PATH` in your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or whatever :)


The src.rpm is also available.
